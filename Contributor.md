# Contributing

The power of open source centers on the ability to collaborate. If you're interested in taking part in SCAMP, we'd love to have you.

## Getting Started
SCAMP is very much a work in progress at the moment. As such, there's a great many of inter-dependencies within the code that makes it difficult for us to carve out work for others to start digging into without a bit of hand holding. So if you're interested in contributing, [please reach out to us][emailus]. 

As we identify isolated tasks going forward, we're going to leverage a specific GitHub issue tag which we will use on issues that we feel anyone can "jump in" to work on. So from time to time, [look for "jump in" issues][jumpin] that we'd welcome anyone to tackle.

 - [Learn more about how "Jump In" issues work](http://nikcodes.com/2013/05/10/new-contributor-jump-in/)

### Making Changes
* Fork our repo and create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are descriptive.
* Pending (SCAMP doesn't yet have unit tests in place)
	* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
	* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

### Coding Styles
	TBD

### Submitting Contributions
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the [SimpleCloudManagerProject][emailus] organization.
	* Reference any issues #'s in the pull request comments.
* Complete the [Contributor License Agreement] if required.
	
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two
  weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

At this point you're waiting on us. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write a [good commit message][commit].

## Reporting Issues
Bugs, defects, typos.. these all happen. If you encounter something, we definitely want to hear about it via one of the options below:

**Email us at [simplecloudmgr@outlook.com][emailus]**: Not our preferred method since only one person checks this currently. 

**Send a [Tweet]**: a better option as it provides more folks an opportunity to see and respond. We also like the thought of the greater transparency. If its big/important, don't be surprised if we ask you to open an issue. 

**[Open an issue on GitHub]**: An incredibly valid option and one that allows us to tag issues to make them more easily searchable. It also provides a great way for us to track any code changes that are related to issues folks bring us. Thus allowing you to know when something has been fixed.
